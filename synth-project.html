<p>The <a href="https://omeka-s.grinnell.edu/s/MusicalInstruments/item/8038#:~:text=The%20theremin%20is%20a%20movement,Anglicized%20form%20as%20Leon%20Theremin" target="_blank">theremin</a> (originally known as the aetherphone), invented by Leon Theremin in 1920, is considered one of the earliest ancestors to the modern synthesizer. It is an electronic music instrument that senses the position of the player's hands and interprets their movements into pitch and volume. It is considered one of the most difficult instruments to play. Clara Rockmore (left) was one of the most well-known theremin players. The theremin has been used in a variety of soundtracks for its haunting, otherworldly sound, most notably in films and TV shows such as <i>The Thing from Another World</i> (the basis for John Carpenter's <i>The Thing</i>), <i>Loki</i>, and <i>Monster House</i>. Music historians have argued over what counts as the first synthesizer, and it's not clear which one is official, but one of the most common picks for the title is RCA's <a href="https://ethw.org/RCA_Mark_I_and_Mark_II_Synthesizers" target="_blank">Mark I</a> vacuum-tube synthesizer. Similar to the earliest computers, it took up the space of an entire room and was "played" with paper punch cards. The first commercially available synthesizer, which was smaller and easier to play than the Mark I, was created by American engineer Robert Moog in 1964. Moog was heavily inspired by the theremin.</p>

    Mort Garson was an early adopter of Moog's debut synthesizer, which, despite its commercial availability, was still a very niche product. Garson's best-known work is his 1976 album <a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/news/celebrating-plantasia" target="_blank"><i>Mother Earth's Plantasia</i></a>, described as "warm earth music for plants...and the people who love them". <i>Plantasia</i> was based on his wife's love of plants and the idea that plants respond to certain types of music. It was initially given a limited release as a free gift with the purchase of either a plant from Mother Earth, a plant shop in Los Angeles, or a Simmons mattress from Sears. Once the 21st century rolled around, it gained cult classic status and was reissued by Sacred Bones Records in 2019. Garson is also known for the first soundtrack composition on the synthesizer — not for a film or television show, but for the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 moon mission.

    <p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wendy-Carlos" target="_blank">Wendy Carlos</a> was another early adopter of the Moog synthesizer. Her first album <i>Switched-On Bach</i>, a collection of Bach pieces performed on the original Moog synth, was a surprising hit, winning three Grammy Awards. It was considered a bridge between technical/experimental and popular use of the synthesizer. Carlos is perhaps best known for her work on the soundtracks for Stanley Kubrick's <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> (1972)and <i>The Shining</i> (1980), as well as the Disney film <i>Tron</i> (1982), all of which popularized the synthesizer in film soundtracks. Carlos, who is a trans woman, also set a precedent for other trans women in electronic music, continuing today with Kim Petras, Laura Les, and the late Sophie Xeon, among others.

    The <a href="https://www.wqxr.org/story/moog-synthesizers-dynamic-musical-history/" target="_blank"></a>first use of the synthesizer in popular music was by the teen-pop Beatles dupe band The Monkees, on the songs "Star Collector" and "Daily Nightly" from their 1967 album <i>Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.</i> The beginning of synth music's mainstream popularity came (arguably less gratingly) a few years later, credited to the German electronic band <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kraftwerk" target="_blank">Kraftwerk</a> ('power plant'). Kraftwerk was founded in 1970. The original lineup consisted of Florian Schneider (1947-2020), Ralf Hütter, Karl Bartos, and Wolfgang Flür. Kraftwerk's last studio album released in 2003, but the band still tours, though Hütter is the only original member in the <a href="http://kraftwerkfaq.hu/members.html#present" target="_blank">current lineup</a>. Kraftwerk is best known for their distinctive sound, which often includes robotic, staccato vocals and "techy" themes like mathematics and computers. They are also often credited with the popularization of synthesizers in mainstream music, paving the way for synthpop artists such as Laurie Anderson, Depeche Mode, Thomas Dolby, New Order, Pet Shop Boys, Tears for Fears, and many others.</p>

<p>Another wildly popular electronic music group was <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Daft-Punk" target="_blank">Daft Punk</a>, a French electronic duo composed in 1993 of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, often colloquially referred to as "the robots." The group's two members wear matching suits and similarly-styled robot masks for performances and media appearances, and do not speak or show their faces while portraying their robot personas. Daft Punk is often considered one of the most influential artists in electronic and dance music. The duo also followed in the footsteps of Wendy Carlos, composing the score to Disney's <i>Tron: Legacy</i>, the 2010 sequel to <i>Tron</i>, and released an animated companion film, <i>Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem</i> to their album <i>Discovery</i> in 2003. Daft Punk broke up in 2021.
